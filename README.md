# hashed-naming-service
In this project, we are going to implement a consistent hashing (CH)-based flat naming system. Consistent hashing provides a lookup service for key-value pairs. The CH system stores (key, value) pairs on a distributed set of servers. These servers collaboratively provide lookup service along with insertion and deletion. In this project, we will implement the CH name servers and a boot-strap CH server, which is a special CH server with certain extra functionalities.
